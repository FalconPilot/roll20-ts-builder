# Roll20 TS Builder

I have nothing to do with Roll20 aside from being a very regular gamemaster/player on this platform. [Check them out right here](https://roll20.net/) if you don't know what it is, it's pretty cool if you like (or if you *would* like getting into) online tabletop gaming.

## What exactly is this ?

The thing is, I love Roll20, and I love that you can create your own character sheets using HTML, CSS or JS. But it's 2020 and I just love my more modern techs (Typescript, Styled-Components, React, etc...) - and therefore have a strong feeling of having to deal with legacy-flavored code when building character sheets.

So this is my take on resolving the matter (at least for me) : a TypeScript builder that can handle building HTML, CSS and JS worker scripts to make custom, compiled character sheets with modern techs.
